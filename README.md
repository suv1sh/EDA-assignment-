# EDA-assignment-
it is having simple regression fuction which has made using given tranning data for predicting the value form using test data samples


Problem Statement
You are given a dataset with 5 features and a target value (continuous). You goal is to
predict the most likely target value for a new sample with 5 features using locally
weighted linear regression. For simplicity, use most similar 25 training samples (along
with their weights) while fitting the locally weighted regression curve.
Purpose of this Assignment
This assignment is intended to test your knowledge on the following three things:
1. Regression in general and locally weighted regression in particular.
2. Optimization algorithm (such as gradient descent) for model training
3. K-nearest neighbor on n-dimensional space.
Data description
File name: eda-18-ass1-data.txt
The file has 7 columns. The first column is the sample id, the next 5 columns are the
feature values and the last column is the target attribute. Each line represent one sample.
